.. i18n: * A cube designer within OpenERP
.. i18n: * Easy to configure: Automatic cube definition (5 clicks, using introspection on database),
.. i18n: * Easy to maintain: The application must be sufficiently intelligent that it requires no fine tuning in cube definition,
.. i18n:   runs well on bad indices, with no need for explicitly defined aggregated tables, or defined axes.
.. i18n: * No intervention from developers: everything achievable through interfaces for end-user.
