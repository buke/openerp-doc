MVC 架构
================

.. i18n: According to `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller>`_, "a Model-view-controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern used in software engineering". In complex computer applications presenting lots of data to the user, one often wishes to separate data (model) and user interface (view) concerns. Changes to the user interface does therefore not impact data management, and data can be reorganized without changing the user interface. The model-view-controller solves this problem by decoupling data access and business logic from data presentation and user interaction, by introducing an intermediate component: the controller.
..

在 `Wikipedia <http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/MVC>`_, "MVC模式（三层架构模式）（Model-View-Controller）是软件工程中的一种软件架构模式". 一个复杂的电脑应用程序会展示大量的数据给用户, 人们希望将数据(model)和界面(view)分离。 改变用户界面并不会影响数据管理，在不改变用户界面的基础上，数据可以得以重新整理。 MVC模式（三层架构模式）通过引入控制器来解耦数据读取和商业逻辑，同时解决数据呈现和用户交互的问题。

.. i18n: For example in the diagram above, the solid lines for the arrows starting from the controller and going to both the view and the model mean that the controller has a complete access to both the view and the model. The dashed line for the arrow going from the view to the controller means that the view has a limited access to the controller. The reasons of this design are :

例如上图中, 带有箭头的实线从控制模同时指向试图和模型，其中的含义是说控制模块对试图和模型具有完全访问权限。 The dashed line for the arrow going from the view to the controller means that the view has a limited access to the controller. The reasons of this design are :

.. i18n:     * From **View** to **Model** : the model sends notification to the view when its data has been modified in order the view to redraw its content. The model doesn't need to know the inner workings of the view to perform this operation. However, the view needs to access the internal parts of the model.
.. i18n:     * From **View** to **Controller** : the reason why the view has limited access to the controller is because the dependencies from the view to the controller need to be minimal: the controller can be replaced at any moment.

.. i18n: also holds the dynamic aspect of the data it controls: methods on the class can

Some widgets may have different representations depending on the context. For example, the one2many widget can be represented as a form with multiple pages or a multi-columns list.

.. i18n: Events on the widgets module are processed with a callback mechanism. A callback mechanism is a process whereby an element defines the type of events he can handle and which methods should be called when this event is triggered. Once the event is triggered, the system knows that the event is bound to a specific method, and calls that method back. Hence callback.

The values *'name_col_a' 'name_col_b' ... 'name_col_n'* are of type string and determine the title of the columns in which the foreign keys from 'tiny.object_a', ..., 'tiny.object_n' are stored.
