在OpenERP中, you have the choice between three ways to receive goods from suppliers. 

.. i18n: The first method is to manually enter the information in the incoming shipment. To receive the products

.. i18n: Management` submenu, click New and then you enter the information about the receipt.

The first method is to manually enter the information in the incoming shipment. To receive the products
through this method, you have to go to :guilabel:`Incoming Shipments` section in the :guilabel:`Warehouse 
Management` submenu, click New and then you enter the information about the receipt.

.. i18n: According to the minimum stock rule of the product ``CPU1``, OpenERP generates a procurement order of 21 units of ``CPU1`` for the company ``Shop 1`` (OP/00007, or another number if you have added extra data). So 21 units of ``CPU1`` move from OpenERP S.A. ``Stock`` to ``Shop 1`` according to their internal configuration of Source and Destination Locations.
