.. i18n: Managing Bank Statements

管理银行对账单
------------------------

.. i18n: OpenERP provides a visual tool for managing bank statements that simplifies data entry into
.. i18n: accounts. As soon as a statement is validated, the corresponding accounting entries are
.. i18n: automatically generated by OpenERP. So non-accounting people can enter financial
.. i18n: transactions without having to worry about things such as credit, debit and counterparts.
..

OpenERP提供了一个可视化的工具来管理银行对账单，简化了账户数据的录入。
当对账单被确认时，OPENERP就会自动生成相应的会计分录。 所以，非会计人员无需担心贷方，借方和counterparts这些事，也可以记录财务事项。

.. i18n: To enter a bank statement, go to the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Bank and Cash --> Bank Statements`.
.. i18n: A data entry form for bank statements then opens as shown in figure :ref:`fig-accstate`.
..

记录一张银行对账单， 转到菜单 :menuselection:`Accounting --> Bank and Cash --> Bank Statements` :menuselection:`会计 -->银行和现金 --> 银行对账单`。
输入数据到银行对账单的表单然后打开如图所示 :ref:`fig-accstate`.

..

.. _fig-accstate:

   *Data Entry Form for a Bank Statement*

.. i18n: The statement reference :guilabel:`Name` and the :guilabel:`Date` are automatically suggested by OpenERP. The :guilabel:`Name` will be filled with the statement number at confirmation of the bank statement. You can configure your own reference by managing sequences in the :menuselection:`Administration --> Configuration --> Sequences` menu.
..

单据引用的 :guilabel:`名称` 和 :guilabel:`日期` 是由OPENERP自动推荐的。这个 :guilabel:`名称` 在银行对账单确认的时候将被单据编号补充。 你可以通过管理序列号来配置你自己的引用，在 :menuselection:`Administration --> Configuration --> Sequences` :menuselection:`系统管理员 --> 设置 --> 序列` 菜单。

.. i18n: Then select the correct :guilabel:`Journal`. Ideally, when you are configuring your company, you would create at
.. i18n: least one journal for each bank account and one journal for petty cash in your company. So select
.. i18n: the journal corresponding to the bank account whose statement you are handling.
..

接着选择 :guilabel:`账簿(Journal)`. 一般来讲,在期初建立账套的时候,最好为公司的每一个银行账户及现金户各建立一个对应的
:guilabel:`账簿(Journal)`. 然后在这里,你选择与本次银行对账相应的账簿即可.

.. i18n: The currency that you are using for the statement line is that of the selected journal. If you are
.. i18n: entering statement lines for an account in American Dollars (USD), the amounts must be entered in
.. i18n: \ ``USD`` \. The currency is automatically converted into the company's main currency when you confirm
.. i18n: the entry, using the rates in effect at the date of entry. (This means that you would need valid
.. i18n: currency conversion rates to be created first. Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Miscellaneous --> Currencies` menu.)

.. i18n: OpenERP automatically completes the initial balance based on the closing balance of the
.. i18n: preceding statement. You can modify this value and force another value. This lets you enter
.. i18n: statements in the order of your choice. Also if you have lost a page of your statement, you can enter
.. i18n: the following ones immediately and you are not forced to wait for a duplicate from the bank.
