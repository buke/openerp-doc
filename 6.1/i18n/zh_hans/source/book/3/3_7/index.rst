 *This chapter traces the basic accounting workflow in OpenERP, from entering an invoice to
 registering payments. The various operations are described, from the entry of accounting receipts to
 the treatment of the reconciliation process, including payment orders.*

.. i18n: Accounting is at the heart of managing a company: all the company's operations have an impact here.

Accounting is at the heart of managing a company: all the company's operations have an impact here.
It has an informational role (how much cash is there? what debts need to be repaid? what is the stock
valuation?) and, because of the information it provides, a reliable and detailed accounting system
can and should have a major decision-making role.

.. i18n: In most companies, accounting is limited to producing statutory reports and satisfying the
.. i18n: directors' curiosity about certain strategic decisions, and to printing the balance sheet and the
.. i18n: income statement several times a year. Even then, there is often several weeks of delay between
.. i18n: reality and the report.

.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         In many small companies, the accounting function is poorly treated.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         Not only do you see the data for documents being entered into the system twice,
.. i18n:         but also the results are often just used to produce legal documents and regular printouts
.. i18n:         of the balance sheet and income statements some weeks after the closing dates.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         By contrast, integrating your accounts with your management system means that you can:
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         * reduce data entry effort – you only need to do it once,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         * run your processes with the benefit of financial vision: for example, in managing projects,
.. i18n:           negotiating contracts, and forecasting cash flow,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         * easily get hold of useful information when you need it, such as a customer's credit position.

is necessary in all of your company's processes for you to be effective, for example:

.. i18n:   to see a history of any delays in payment,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * if a given customer has exceeded his credit limit, accounting can automatically stop further

.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * if a project budget is 80% consumed, but the project is only 20% complete, you could renegotiate
.. i18n:   with the client, or review and rein in the objectives of the project,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * if you need to improve your company's cash flow then you could plan your service projects on the

.. i18n:   you could work on short-term client projects in preference to R&D projects, for example.
