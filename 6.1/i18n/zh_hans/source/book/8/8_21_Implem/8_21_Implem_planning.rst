OpenERP is so easy to start using that it is not always obvious, particularly to IT staff, that a
clear requirements plan is necessary for implementing the system successfully. The difficulty is not
particularly in installing the software nor in configuring it, but rather more about:

.. i18n: * knowing what to configure,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * deciding if you should adapt the software, or perhaps change your method of working, for some of
.. i18n:   your specialized processes,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * forming teams that can specify and work on some of the changes,

.. i18n: * ensuring that your users are committed to the change.

ERP system implementation is a project carried out using information technology, but it is a business
project rather than an IT project in itself. The challenge of this type of project is in changing
the behaviour of those involved at all levels of the enterprise.

.. i18n: People in the IT department will certainly be an integral part of the project, but they should be
.. i18n: managed by someone in a senior position, who both understands the business impact across the
.. i18n: organization and has experience of technical projects. Ideally, the project manager should know the

.. i18n: offer. This means that you subcontract all the difficult technology, from the installation of the
.. i18n: server to its maintenance, all the while being assured of the installation of a robust architecture

.. i18n: The menus themselves hint at several helpful implementation suggestions, for example, the sub-menus of
.. i18n: :menuselection:`Administration --> Configuration` are useful for the configuration of the software.
.. i18n: New functions such as the :guilabel:`Module Recorder` enable you to significantly accelerate the configuration
