Two types of training are provided by the Tiny company and its partners:

.. i18n: * Technical training in OpenERP: the objective of this intensive training is to enable you to
.. i18n:   develop your own modules by modifying and adapting the existing ones. It covers the creation of new
.. i18n:   objects, menus, reports and workflows, and also of interfaces with external software. It lasts for
.. i18n:   five days and is designed for IT people.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * User training: this enables you to be productive as rapidly as possible in the use of OpenERP.
.. i18n:   All of the modules there are detailed with concrete examples and different exercises. For the sake
.. i18n:   of realism, the training uses data for a fictitious company. This training also lasts for five days.
.. i18n:   It is designed for those responsible for an ERP project, who will then be capable of training
.. i18n:   employees internally.

.. i18n: In summary, you should arrange both user training and self-paced training (perhaps based on this
.. i18n: book series) if you can. Technical training is strongly advised if you see yourselves developing your own
.. i18n: modules. Although it is not obligatory, it gives you quite a time advantage in any serious OpenERP
