.. i18n:   through the company management software,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Automatic assignment of meta-information comes directly from information contained in your
.. i18n:   OpenERP login registration,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Document workflow, which automatically follows OpenERP's documentation process, provides complete
.. i18n:   synchronization between the systems,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Document classification is determined by OpenERP itself so that the structure that is created is
.. i18n:   always synchronized between the systems,
.. i18n:
