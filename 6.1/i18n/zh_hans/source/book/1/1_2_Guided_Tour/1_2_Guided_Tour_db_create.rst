创建数据库
=================

.. i18n: Use the technique outlined in :ref:`ch-inst` to create a new database, \ ``openerp_ch02``\  . This
.. i18n: database will contain the demonstration data provided with OpenERP and a large proportion of the
.. i18n: core OpenERP functionality. You will need to know your super administrator password for this – or
.. i18n: you will have to find somebody who does have it to create this seed database.
..

在 :ref:`ch-inst` 中使用概要的技术来创建一个新的数据库，\ ``openerp_ch02``\  。这个
数据库将包含由OpenERP提供的演示数据以及绝大多数的OpenERP核心功能。
您需要知道系统的超级管理员密码 – 又或找到拥有它的人来创建此种子数据库。

.. i18n: Start the database creation process from the :guilabel:`Login` page by clicking
.. i18n: :guilabel:`Databases` and then completing the following fields on the :guilabel:`Create Database` form:
..

要启动数据库的创建进程，请从 :guilabel:`Login` 页点击
:guilabel:`Databases` 然后填写并完成 :guilabel:`Create Database` 表单项:

.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Super admin password` : by default it is \ ``admin``\  , if you or your system
.. i18n:    administrator have not changed it,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`New database name` : \ ``openerp_ch02``\  ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Load Demonstration data` checkbox: \ ``checked``\  ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Default Language` : \ ``English (US)``\  ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Administrator password` : \ ``admin``\  (because it is easiest to remember at this stage, but obviously completely insecure),
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Confirm password` : \ ``admin``\  .
..

*  :guilabel:`Super admin password` : 缺省是 \ ``admin``\  , 如果你的系统管理员没有更改,

*  :guilabel:`New database name` : \ ``openerp_ch02``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Load Demonstration data` checkbox: \ ``checked``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Default Language` : \ ``English (US)``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Administrator password` : \ ``admin``\  (因为它在目前阶段最容易记住，但很明显：非常不安全),

*  :guilabel:`Confirm password` : \ ``admin``\  .
