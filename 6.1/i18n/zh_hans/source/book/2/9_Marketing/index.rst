.. i18n: A marketing campaign is an event or an activity that will help you manage and reach your partners with specific messages. A campaign can have many activities that will be triggered from a specific situation, for instance a response from a contact to an email you sent. The result of such a response (action) could be the sending of an email, for which a template has previously been created in OpenERP.
..

市场营销活动是通过个性化的消息帮助管理和接触你的目标客户的一次事件或一个活动。一个营销活动在具体的营销环境下可以有很多行为被触发，例如一次实时的响应通过你发送邮件的接触。这种响应（或触发行为）的结果可以是一次邮件的发送，发送的内容在这之前已经在OPENERP里预先编辑好。

.. i18n: To use the email functionality, you have to configure your email account. This is explained in the chapter :ref:`ch-crm-fetchmail-install`.

Inappropriate focus on the wrong segment would result in the campaign being misfired and our efforts would reach deaf ears.

.. i18n: Through the `Segment` tab in the **Campaign** module, we can define our segment for each Campaign activity.

You can also synchronize the entire campaign steps according to the defined segments.

.. i18n: Our insurance company wants to attack the Spanish market, and will define a segment called Spanish Leads. Of course you would want your segment to be valid for leads coming from Spain only. To achieve this, go to the **Leads** list view. Filter all the leads for Spain (type *Spain* in the `Country` field), make sure to clear the salesteam, so that all leads coming from Spain will be selected. Then click `Save Filter` and call it for instance *Spanish Leads*. Now return to the **Campaigns** menu and open the `Segment`, then click the ``Filter`` field to select *Spanish Leads*. The segment will now only apply to Spanish leads.

Once a lead meets our objective criteria of goals, we change the lead status by converting it into an **Opportunity**, meaning that we should give focused attention.

创建营销活动的指导方针
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. i18n:  * It is a good idea to have an initial activity that will change some fields on the objects entering the campaign to mark them as such, to avoid mixing them in other processes (e.g. set a specific state and Sales Team on a CRM lead being processed by a campaign). You can also define a time delay so that the campaign seems more human (note if the answer comes in a matter of seconds or minutes it is computer generated).
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:  * Put a stop condition on each subsequent activity in the campaign to get items out of the campaign as soon as the goal is achieved (e.g. every activity has a partial condition on the state of the item, if CRM Leads stops being Pending, the campaign ends for that case).

 * It is a good idea to have an initial activity that will change some fields on the objects entering the campaign to mark them as such, to avoid mixing them in other processes (e.g. set a specific state and Sales Team on a CRM lead being processed by a campaign). You can also define a time delay so that the campaign seems more human (note if the answer comes in a matter of seconds or minutes it is computer generated).

 * Put a stop condition on each subsequent activity in the campaign to get items out of the campaign as soon as the goal is achieved (e.g. every activity has a partial condition on the state of the item, if CRM Leads stops being Pending, the campaign ends for that case).
