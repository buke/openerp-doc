.. i18n: directly assigned to a user or left unassigned. Each employee then chooses the task that he or she

.. i18n:     IT project that is estimated to be around six months of work. This project is managed by iterative
.. i18n:     cycles of development of around a month, and a presentation is made to the client at the end of
.. i18n:     each cycle to track the progress of the project. At this meeting, you plan what must be carried
.. i18n:     out for the following month. At the end of the month, the account manager for the project invoices
.. i18n:     the client for the work done on the project.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     Suppose that the project encounters a delay because it is more complex than expected. There are

.. i18n:     * late in your delivery of the planned functions, or 
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     * on time, but with fewer functions than planned.

.. i18n:     If your planning is based on phases and tasks you will report at the client meeting that it will

.. i18n:     phase and plan the new one, but only be able to present part of the planned functionality.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     If the client is sensitive to delay, the first approach will cause acute unhappiness. You will have
.. i18n:     to re-plan the project and all of its future phases to take account of that delay. Some problems
.. i18n:     are also likely to occur later with invoicing, because it will be difficult for you to invoice

    * late in your delivery of the planned functions, or

.. i18n:
