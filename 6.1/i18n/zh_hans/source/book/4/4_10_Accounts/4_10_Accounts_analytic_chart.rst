In 
在制造行业，财务分析图表（analytic charts of accounts）常常是按照公司本身的部门和产品来组织的。
.. i18n: So the objective is to examine the costs, sales and margins by department and by product. The first level of the structure comprises the different departments, and the lower levels represent the product ranges the company makes and sells.

因此，财务分析的目标就是按照部门和产品审查成本，销售和利润.第一层由不同的部门组成，下边的一层代表公司所生产和销售的产品范围。

.. i18n: In OpenERP, each analytic line lists the number of units sold or used, as well as what you would usually find there – the amount in currency units (USD or GBP, or whatever other choice you make). So you can sum the quantities sold and used on each analytic account to determine whether any hours of the support contract remain.

.. tip:: Cash Budgets

        Problems of cash management are amongst the main difficulties encountered by small growing businesses.
        It is really difficult to predict the amount of cash that will be available when a company is young
        and rapidly growing.

        If the company adopts management by case, then staff planning can be represented in the analytic
        accounts report, as you have seen.

        But since you know your selling price for each of the different projects, you can see that it is easy to use the plan in the analytic accounts to more precisely forecast the amounts that you will invoice in the coming months.
