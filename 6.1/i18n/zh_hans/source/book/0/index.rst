前言

.. i18n: Information Systems have played an increasingly visible role over the past several years in
.. i18n: improving the competitiveness of business.
.. i18n: More than just tools for handling repetitive tasks, they are used to guide and advance
.. i18n: all of a company's' daily activities. Integrated management software is today very often a
.. i18n: key source of significant competitive advantage.
..

近些年来，提高企业的竞争力，信息系统日益发挥着显着的作用。
作为处理企业复杂的重复性的任务的工具，它们被用来指导并促进
企业的日常业务活动。现在集成的管理软件是具有显著竞争优势的主要来源。

.. i18n: The standard response to a need for responsiveness, reliability, and rapidly
.. i18n: increasing expectations is to create an organization based on departments with
.. i18n: a clear linear structure, integrated around your operating processes.  To
.. i18n: increase efficiency amongst salespeople, accountants, logistics staff and
.. i18n: everyone else you should have a common understanding of your problems.
..

建立一个具有清晰的线性部门组织结构，快速反应作为反应的标准是必须的，
可靠的, 快速增长的预期，集成了你企业的运作流程。为了提高效率，包括销
售人员，会计人员，后勤人员和其他人，应该有一个共同的认识问题的平台。

.. i18n: For this you need a common language for shared references, policies and communication.
.. i18n: An ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system provides the ideal platform for this common reference
.. i18n: point.
..

对于这一点，你需要共享参考、策略和沟通的共同语言。ERP（企业资源规划）系统
提供了这一理想的平台，为这一共享的参考点。

.. i18n: Open Source software at the Service of Management
.. i18n: =================================================
..

企业管理之开源软件
=================================================

.. i18n: Risks and integration costs are important barriers to all the advantages you gain from such systems.
.. i18n: That is why, today, few small- and medium-sized companies use ERP.
.. i18n: In addition, the larger ERP vendors such as SAP, Microsoft and Oracle have not been able
.. i18n: to reconcile the power and comprehensive cover of an ERP system with the simplicity and flexibility
.. i18n: wanted by the users.
.. i18n: But this is exactly what small and medium enterprises are looking for.
..

风险与整合的成本是企业从ERP系统中获利的重要的障碍。这就是为什么今天中小型企业很少使用ERP的原因。
另外，像SAP、微软和Oracle这样的大型ERP软件供应商也还不能解决ERP软件强大的处理能力与用户对ERP系统的简单性和灵活性的普遍需求。
但这却正是中小型企业所需要的。


.. i18n: The development processes of Open Source Software, and the new business models adopted by their
.. i18n: developers, provide a new way of resolving such cost and quality issues for this kind of enterprise
.. i18n: software.
..

开源软件的开发过程与开发人员所采用的新的商业模式为解决这类企业软件的成本与质量问题提供了一种新的思路。

.. i18n: To make an ERP system fully available to small and medium enterprises, cost reduction is the first
.. i18n: priority.
.. i18n: Open source software makes it possible to greatly reduce development costs by
.. i18n: aggressive reuse of open source software libraries; to eliminate intermediaries (the distributors),
.. i18n: with all of their expensive sales overhead; to cut out selling costs by free publication of the
.. i18n: software;
.. i18n: and to considerably reduce the marketing overhead.
..

要让一个ERP系统在中小企业里完全有效的运行，降低成本是第一要务。开源软件利用强大的可重用软件库
使大幅度降低开发成本成为可能；它减少了批发商的中间环节同时也相应降低了他们高昂的销售费用所引发的成本；而且
软件的免费发布也减少了高昂的销售和市场费用。


.. i18n: Since there is open interaction among thousands of contributors and partners working on the same
.. i18n: project, the quality of the resulting software greatly benefits from the scrutiny.
.. i18n: And you cannot be everything at once: accountant, software developer, salesperson,
.. i18n: ISO 9001 quality professional, specialist in agricultural products,
.. i18n: expert in the customs and habits of pharmaceutical vendors, just as a start.
..

因为有成千上万的贡献者与合作伙伴在同一个项目上通力合作，所以软件的质量极大地得益于彼此之间的审查。
你不可能同时做所有的事情：会计，软件开发，销售，ISO9001质量管理，农产品专家，药品专家，这些只是其中的一部分而已。

.. i18n: Faced with these wide-ranging requirements, what could be better than a worldwide network of
.. i18n: partners and contributors?
.. i18n: Every single person adds own contributions according to his or her professional competence.
.. i18n: Throughout this book you will see that the results exceed any reasonable expectations when such work
.. i18n: is well organized.
..

面对这些广泛的需求，还有什么能比建立起一个全球范围内的合作伙伴和贡献者网络更好的方式呢？
每个人都根据他或她的专业能力，提供自己的才能。
通过本书，你会了解到当这些工作被良好的组织到一起时，结果将超出任何合理的预期。

.. i18n: But the real challenge of development is to make this solution simple and flexible, as well as
.. i18n: complete.
.. i18n: And to reach this level of quality you need a leader and co-ordinator who can organize all of these
.. i18n: activities.
.. i18n: So the development team of Tiny ERP, today called OpenERP, is responsible for most of
.. i18n: the organization, synchronization and coherence of the software.
..

但是开发中真正的挑战是确保该方法的简单、灵活和完整。
要达到这种层次的质量要求你需要一个领导者和协调者，他可以组织所有这些活动。
所以TinyERP的开发团队，现在叫OpenERP，主要负责组织，同步和软件的一致性。


.. i18n: And OpenERP offers great performance in all these areas!
..

OpenERP在所有这些方面都表现得非常出色！

.. i18n: The OpenERP Solution
.. i18n: ====================
..

OpenERP 解决方案
====================

.. i18n: Because of its modularity, collaborative developments in OpenERP have been cleanly integrated,
.. i18n: enabling any company to choose from a large list of available functions.
.. i18n: As with most open source software, accessibility, flexibility and ease of use are important keywords
.. i18n: for development.
.. i18n: Experience has shown that there is no need to train users for several months on the system,
.. i18n: because they can just download it and use it directly.
..

由于OpenERP采用模块化，并且协同开发已完全集成在里面，所以任何公司都可以从它庞大的功能列表中找到适合自己的功能。
对于大多数开源软件来说，可访问性，灵活性和易用性是重要的关键词。经验表明没有必要在系统上培训用户数个月，
因为他们可以直接下载并使用它。

.. i18n: So you will find modules to suit all kinds of needs, allowing your company to build its customized
.. i18n: system
.. i18n: by simply grouping and configuring the most suitable modules. Hundreds of modules are available.
..

所以你将找到适合各种需求的模块，可供选择的模块有上百种，你可以通过简单的分组和配置找到最适合的模块，利用他们
为你的公司建立起量身定制的系统。

.. i18n: They range from specific modules like the EDI interface for agricultural products,
.. i18n: which has been used to interface with Match and Leclerc stores, up to the generic demonstration
.. i18n: automation module for ordering sandwiches, which can take care of the eating preferences of your staff.
..

They range from specific modules like the EDI interface for agricultural products,
which has been used to interface with Match and Leclerc stores, up to the generic demonstration
automation module for ordering sandwiches, which can take care of the eating preferences of your staff.

.. i18n: The results are rather impressive. OpenERP (originally called Tiny ERP) is a Management
.. i18n: Software that is downloaded more than any other in the world, with over 600 downloads per day.
.. i18n: Today it is available in 18 languages and has a worldwide network of partners and contributors.
.. i18n: Over 800 developers participate in the projects on the collaborative development system.
..

结果非常优秀。OpenERP（原本称作Tiny ERP）是一个管理软件，在全世界范围内它比其它的同类软件获得更多的下载次数，每天超过600次。
现在它支持18中语言并且有一个世界范围的合作伙伴和贡献者网络。超过800名开发者共同参与并开发了这个项目。

.. i18n: To our knowledge, OpenERP is the only management system which is routinely used not only by big
.. i18n: companies but also by very small companies and independent companies. This diversity is an
.. i18n: illustration of the software's flexibility: a rather elegant coordination between people's
.. i18n: functional expectations of the software and great ease of use.
..

据我们所知，OpenERP是唯一的一个不是仅仅被大公司使用的管理系统，它还被很多小公司和独立公司所采用。
这个不同是一个很好的例证，说明了OpenERP的灵活性：在人们广泛希望的功能性与易用性之间优雅的进行协调。

.. i18n: And this diversity is also found in the various sectors and trades which use the software, including
.. i18n: agricultural products, textiles, public auctions, IT, and trade associations.
..

这种多样性还发生在不同的部门和行业中，他们都使用OpenERP，包括农产品，纺织品，公开拍卖，IT，和行业协会。


.. i18n: Last but not least, such software has arisen from the blend of high code quality, well-judged architecture and
.. i18n: use of free technologies. In fact, you may be surprised (if you are an IT person) to find that the
.. i18n: download size of OpenERP is only around 6 MB. When that is expanded during installation its size is mostly
.. i18n: attributable to all the official translations that are packaged with it, not the operating code.
.. i18n: We've moved a long way from
.. i18n: the days when the only people who could be expected to benefit from ERP were the owners of a widget
.. i18n: factory on some remote industrial estate.
..

最后我们希望说明的是，本软件诞生于高质量的代码，良好的体系结构和免费的技术。事实上，你可能惊讶的（如果你从事IT行业）发现OpenERP
的下载包只有差不多6MB. 在安装时展开后，它的大小会改变，这主要是由于官方的翻译也被打包在里面，而不是因为代码的原因。但是我们希望表达的远不止于此。
自从那些地处偏远的工厂的所有者预期可以从ERP受益开始至今，我们已经走过了如此长的一段路。

Many books set out to tell readers about the management of enterprise, and equally many aim to
instruct the reader in the use of a piece of specialized software. We are not aiming to add to those
lists because our approach is intended to be different.

.. i18n: Having restructured and reorganized many businesses, we wanted our management experience to generate
.. i18n: a work that is both instructive and practical. It was important for us not to write a manual about
.. i18n: OpenERP, but instead a work that deals with advanced management techniques realized through these
.. i18n: IT tools. You will see what management practices might be useful, what is possible, and then how you
.. i18n: could achieve that in OpenERP.
