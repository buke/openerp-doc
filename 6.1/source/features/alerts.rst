Alerts
======

OpenERP has an integrated alert/warning system. You can configure alerts on any
step of any operation. The end-user will receive alerts on different events. We can
trigger alerts on the screen or through the internal requests system. It allows
display of the right information at the right time for each user. It also simplifies
communication between employees in the same company.
