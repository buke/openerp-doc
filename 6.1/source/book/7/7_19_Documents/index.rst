   single: Document Management

******************************
Integrated Document Management
******************************

 *Information management has become a major strategic factor in companies' development.
 It is important to get the right information circulated to the right people, as efficiently
 as possible, yet still keep it secure.
 Document management provides a way for companies to organize their information, in all its
 forms, in one place.*

The objectives of document management include easier archiving, access and reference, intelligent
classification and distribution of documents and the information they contain. It concerns sets of
all sorts of company documents such as work procedures, meeting reports, documents received from
customers and suppliers, documents sent to customers, faxes, sales presentations and product
datasheets.

For this chapter you should start with a fresh database that includes demo data,
with :mod:`sale`, :mod:`document` and their dependencies installed and 
no particular chart of accounts configured.
