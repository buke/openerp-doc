 *This chapter describes OpenERP's main Human Resources and Employee Services features.
 Most of the solutions discussed after this chapter concern management by
 business or by project, and depend mostly on analytic accounting, with each business or project
 represented by an analytic account.*

A company's effectiveness depends on its employees' good work. OpenERP's Human
Resources modules enable you to manage important aspects of staff work efficiently, such as their
skills, contracts, and working time.

For this chapter, you should start with a fresh database that includes demo data.
To configure the Human Resource Application you should check `Human Resources` in the
following configuration wizard.
