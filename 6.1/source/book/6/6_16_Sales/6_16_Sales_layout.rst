Changing Order Layout
=====================

.. index::
   single: module; sale_layout

Install the :mod:`sale_layout` module by selecting :guilabel:`Sales Order Layout Improvement` and clicking :guilabel:`Configure` in the :guilabel:`Reconfigure` wizard. It enables you to have a more flexible template than the standard order forms. 

For example, you could put the following in the order lines:

* a horizontal separator line,

* titles and subtitles,

* subtotals at the end of the section,

* comments,

* a page break.

.. index::
   single: module; account_invoice_layout

This enables you to lay out a more elaborate, professional-looking quotation page. The
module :mod:`account_invoice_layout` (installed automatically on installation of :mod:`sale_layout`),
also gives you the same functionality for invoice templates.

The two figures :ref:`fig-invlayfrm` and :ref:`fig-invlayprin` show an invoice template in OpenERP 
and the resulting printed invoice.
