Integrated E-commerce
=====================

OpenERP provides modules that synchronise automatically with popular open source
eCommerce systems: OSCommerce, eZpublish, Magento, Joomla. It allows you to
streamline and automate the sales process, from the online order to the
delivery and the invoicing.

To benefit from all the power of OpenERP (pricelists management, complex
taxes, warehouse integration, etc.), you can also use our own eCommerce system
that automatically plugs in an existing website. Add a few lines of HTML in your
website and OpenERP converts it to a full featured eCommerce platform.
