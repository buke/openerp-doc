FAQ about documentation Licence
===============================

Why not use a free documentation licence ?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To achieve very high quality documentation, we are managing it as a standard
publication process, with quality reviews by an editor. We also think that
the documentation is worth being distributed in bookstores as printed editions
on paper. It gives very good worldwide visibility for the product.

When working with professional editors, like Eyrolles, they ask for
copyrights on the (translated) content so that they can easily invest in
mass printing and distribution of the book. To take this risk, they need 
protection on versions of the book that is not compatible with the GFPL.


Do you accept contributions from everyone to modify the book ?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our goal is to accept most of the contributions and contributors. So we provide
written authorisation if you contribute significantly.

But we must keep control of the book content to ensure:
* Editors' rights are not infringed
* Incentives like paid authors/translators rights are not infringed

The errata section is public on the wiki. Everyone can contribute in this
section. Then an author can review modification proposals and apply them in
his or her own way.

Why is this a good approach ?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The documentation of OpenERP is one of our biggest priorities. We currently
have the best documentation amongst all open source ERP systems but it's not
enough and I am sure we can do much more better.

**Writing Good Documentation is Complex**

For years we have tried to develop community based documentation on a wiki where
everyone contributes. With OpenERP we have a strong community but, after years,
the community documentation still does not reach our expectations:

* Deprecated compared to new versions of the software,
* Original authors do not maintain what they write / contribute,
* Appears like we assembled different pieces of unrelated documentation,
* Sometimes contributions come from people that do not understand the software well enough,
* Not end-user oriented,
* Some have experience only in food industries, others services companies, others manufacturing, etc.

As a result we decided to review the way we will write and maintain future
documentation about OpenERP and Open Object.

**The Process**

Most of the best open source documentation has been fully written in one try
by only one or two people / authors. After that, the community improved the
content with small improvements here and there.

So I think we'd be better to focus our resources on some good individuals
rather than a global community. But writing a complete document (or even a
complete chapter) can take a long time (we took about 200 hours to write the
OpenERP book in French, 280 pages). So we need incentives to motivate these
contributors / authors.

So, we decided to manage all documentation about OpenERP like any other
book edition. We will set up an editing chain with the following actors:

* The editors: will work with authors to review the quality of the book and will distribute in a range of countries through webshops and real bookstores. The editor also defines author contracts and the graphics, charts and style. He will manage the collections (set of books).
* The authors: everyone can write his own chapter(s) and propose them to the editor. The editor will make a selection of chapters to publish complete books.
* Re-Readers: will re-read books before publication and work with the editor to achieve a high level of quality.
* Translators: will translate a particular book to their mother tongue based on the English version.

Editors will be different according to the countries/translations of the book.
For all French countries, we already contracted our preceding books with
Eyrolles. For the English version, we will create our own company edition to
keep the rights on the text so that we can publish it online for free.

Now, we have our incentives for authors and translators:

* Getting monthly revenue through author rights based on monthly sales,
* Being published in bookstores with our worldwide distribution channel.

Having established that, this should leverage individuals effort and promote
contributions on writing good documentation. As people will be published and
paid for their good work, this should promote new authors and translators.

Books are sold in bookstores in different countries and languages, which allows
us to remunerate the full edition chain through author rights. It will help us
to motivate authors and translators to write more chapters, and improve
existing ones.

We had to find a good middle point between selling through bookstores to
remunerate authors and publishing online to provide a free version. So, most of
our books (depending on the contract we have with the editor in the related
country), will be published online some months after their official
publication.

Our goal is to create many different books for different domains: technical
books, marketing management, services companies management, openerp for
accountants, ...

Book writing will be our main documentation process. At each new version of
OpenERP, we will release new versions of the different books. The editor will
organise this and will get revenues for this.

In addition to this, we use a community wiki for all others documentations that
are not directly related to the software or for documentations that are "per
module". For our main knowledge management system, we use Launchpad Answers,
where you can ask questions or reply answers.


**The Role of The Community**

This documentation writing and maintaining process tends to emphasize
individual efforts from authors and translators. This does not means we think
the community is less important for writing documentations. The community
remains very important for different reasons:

* The community provides authors and translators because everyone can request to be an author for one or several chapters, no need to write a full book.
* The editor needs readers that will review the book before his official release.
* These readers will be chosen amongst the different contributors in the community.

To improve the quality of books versions after versions, we will extensively
work on errata in the wiki. Community will be able to propose improvement
through the errata section.

Allowing everyone to contribute in errata instead of directly in the content
allows us to keep into control on the quality of our documentations.
