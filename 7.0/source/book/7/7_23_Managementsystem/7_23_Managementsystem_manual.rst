Manuals
=======

.. index::
   single: manual
   single: module; wiki_quality_manual
   single: module; wiki_environment_manual

Each management system starts with a manual reflecting the structure of the corresponding ISO standards. 
You can fill in the blanks in the structure of the wiki page from the menu :menuselection:`Knowledge --> Collaborative Content --> Wiki pages`.

Procedures and Environmental Aspects
====================================

.. index::
   single: procedure 
   single: environmental aspect 
   single: module; wiki_procedure
   single: module; wiki_environmental_aspect

Once you have created your manual, you will have to complete it with procedures or environmental aspects. 
They are both managed through wiki pages in the same menu as the manual and the structure is already provided.
