Prior to create a nonconformity, you need to create the list of origins (how you 
discovered your nonconformities) and causes (the root causes) of your nonconformities 
from the menu :menuselection:`Management System --> Configuration --> Nonconformities`.

Then you can create nonconformities directly from the audit or from the menu :menuselection:
`Management System --> Management System --> Nonconformities`. You set the partner 
involved by the nonconformity, an identifier to what it is related to and the employee 
responsible for the nonconformity, with his manager.

   *Nonconformity*


You then choose the origins of the nonconformity and the procedure involved. In the 
description, you explain and detail the nonconformity with facts and evidences. 
You choose the cause and then analyze why the nonconformity happened in order to 
suggest immediate, corrective and preventive actions.

Once all the actions have proven to be completed and efficient, you can close the 
nonconformity.
