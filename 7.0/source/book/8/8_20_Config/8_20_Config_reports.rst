Configuring Reports
===================

OpenERP has two distinct report types:

* Statistical reports: these are calculated data, often represented in the form of lists or graphs.
  These reports are dynamic, and you can navigate through the data that comprise the figures through
  the client interface.

* Report documents: they are used to print system documents. The result is usually a PDF generated by
  a selection made on the screen. Furthermore, OpenERP enables you to open these reports in
  OpenOffice.org to edit in any changes you want before sending them to your customer.

Because of the power of the OpenERP engine, these two types of report can be created or modified
without needing any development, and this can be done directly in the client interface of OpenERP
or from OpenOffice.org.

Managing Statistical Reports
----------------------------

Many reports are configured in advance in OpenERP. You can find them in the :menuselection:`Reporting` sub-menus
under each main menu entry.

Modelling a New Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   single: module; base_report_creator

OpenERP gives you the possibility of developing your own analyses to meet your specific needs. To
define a new analysis of the system's data, you should install the module :mod:`base_report_creator`.
You can do so by using the :guilabel:`Reconfigure` wizard and installing :guilabel:`Advanced Reporting`.
Then as you configure the reporting tools, select :guilabel:`Query Builder` for installation.
This enables you to create complex queries on the database, in a simple and visual way.

Once the module is installed, create a new report using the menu :menuselection:`Administration --> Customization -->
Reporting --> Custom Reports`.

Give a :guilabel:`Report Name` to your new report and select the objects that you are going to
analyse. For example, select the :guilabel:`project.vs.hours` object (you have to install :guilabel:`Project Management` for this).

Then turn to the second tab :guilabel:`View parameters` to select the views that you want in your
report. Select \ ``Tree``\   in the :guilabel:`First View` and \ ``Graph``\   in the :guilabel:`Second
View`. You can choose the type of graph displayed using the :guilabel:`Graph View` fields. You could
also select \ ``Calendar``\   as a view if you were going to add a date field to your
report.

   *Fields selected for the project analysis*

In the third tab :guilabel:`Fields to Display` you must indicate which of the fields in the list you want to be shown in your report. Complete the screen along the lines of the figure above.

	#. The :guilabel:`Sequence` field gives the order of the fields displayed.

	#. :guilabel:`Field`, the second column, enables you to select a field from any of the objects
	   you selected in the first tab.

	#. :guilabel:`Grouping Method`, the third column lets you to determine the grouping operation that
	   is to be applied to this field:

	        - :guilabel:`Grouped` : Enables you to group document entries with the same value in this field.

	        - :guilabel:`Sum` : Gives the sum of values in this field.

	        - :guilabel:`Minimum` : Gives the minimum of all the values that appear in this field.

	        - :guilabel:`Maximum` : Gives the maximum of all the values that appear in this field.

	        - :guilabel:`Average` : Gives the arithmetic average of all the values in this field.

	        - :guilabel:`Count` : Gives the count of all the values in this field.

	#. :guilabel:`Graph Mode`, the fourth column, determines if the field will appear in the graph view
	   and, if so, on which axis (X or Y).

	#. :guilabel:`Calendar Mode`, the fifth column, enables you to specify if the field can be the
	   basis of a calendar view.

In the fourth tab :guilabel:`Filters on Fields`, you can add filters on all the fields of the selected
objects. To do that, use the button :guilabel:`Add filter` at the
top of this tab. For the moment, do not add a filter.

You can now :guilabel:`Save` the report you defined. Click on the :guilabel:`Open Report` button to
the right of the form on the :guilabel:`General Configuration` tab to get the requested analysis.

Configuring the Dashboards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A dashboard is a selection of reports previously defined in OpenERP. You can choose from hundreds
of predefined reports and, for each report, indicate its position on the dashboard.

Just like fields on reports, the :guilabel:`Sequence` field determines the order in which views
appear in the dashboard.

.. figure::  images/dashboard_config.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 85

   *Definition of a new dashboard*

Once the dashboard has been defined through the menu
:menuselection:`Administration --> Customization --> Reporting --> Dashboard Definition`,
you can use the :guilabel:`Create Menu` button to create a menu
entry for your dashboard anywhere in the menu system.

Managing Document Templates with OpenOffice.org
-----------------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: module; base_report_designer

To configure your printable documents in OpenERP, use the module :mod:`base_report_designer`.
To install this module use the :guilabel:`Reconfigure` wizard and ensuring that :guilabel:`Advanced Reporting` is installed, configure :guilabel:`OpenOffice Report Designer` for installation.

.. tip:: The OpenOffice.org Writer Plug-in

	You can create your own reports in just a few minutes using the OpenOffice.org Writer plug-in.
	This tool can give your team a big productivity improvement.
	Using it, you can create templates for all of your company's documents, reducing the work of
	creating and laying out data and customer documents.

The system is both simple and powerful, because it gives you the benefits of all of the layout
facilities offered by OpenOffice.org Writer, as well as all of the data and calculation provided by
OpenERP. You could create or modify reports directly from OpenOffice.org and then use them in
OpenERP.

.. note:: Independence from OpenOffice.org

	OpenOffice.org is only used to generate new document templates.
	The system administrator is the only person who has to install it.

	Once the document templates have been defined, the users do not need it to carry out their normal
	work.
	They can use either Microsoft Office or OpenOffice.org as they choose.

The OpenOffice.org plug-in enables you to search for fields in OpenERP and integrate them into
your document templates. You can use data loops in tables or sections, enabling you to attach
several lines to an order, for example.

Once the new report has been defined, it appears directly in the OpenERP client for the system
users.

There are two modes of using reports:

* make the report produce a PDF document with data in it reflecting the selected record (for
  example, an invoice).

* make the report open a document for modification in OpenOffice.org, with data in it reflecting the
  selected record. This enables you to modify the document in OpenOffice.org before sending it to the
  customer (such as with a Quotation).

The personalized reports are stored in the OpenERP database and are accessible to everyone who has
rights to use your database without any need for the installation of OpenOffice.org on their own
computers. The document modifications are applied to a single database.

Installing the OpenOffice.org Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should install two components before using the report editor:

* the module :mod:`base_report_designer` – first in your OpenERP installation if it is not
  already there, and then in the OpenERP database, you want to use it in.

* the OpenOffice.org Report Designer in the OpenOffice.org installation on your system
  administrator's computer.

You start by installing the module :mod:`base_report_designer` just like all the other OpenERP
modules.

To install the OpenOffice.org extension, save the file \ ``openerp_report_designer.zip`` \ supplied during
the OpenERP Report Designer Configuration. Check that OpenOffice.org is properly installed on your
computer and that you have administration rights for installation.

.. figure::  images/tinyreport.png
   :scale: 65
   :align: center

   *Menu OpenERP Report in OpenOffice.org Writer*

Start OpenOffice.org Writer, select :menuselection:`Tools --> Extension Manager...`  to open the
Extension Manager dialog box, and then search for the \ ``openerp_report_designer.zip``\   file to install it.
Then close the application and restart Writer: a new menu appears in the top menu bar –  :guilabel:`OpenERP
Report Designer`.

.. index::
   pair: report; OpenOffice.org

Connecting OpenOffice.org to OpenERP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select :menuselection:`OpenERP Report Designer --> Server parameters` in the top menu of OpenOffice.org
Writer. You can then enter your connection parameters to the OpenERP server. You must select a
database in which you have already installed the module :mod:`purchase`. A message
appears if you have made a successful connection.

.. index::
   single: report; modify

Modifying a Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The report editor lets you:

* modify existing reports which will then replace the originals in your OpenERP database,

* create new reports for the selected object.

To modify an existing report, select :menuselection:`OpenERP Report Designer --> Modify Existing Report`.
Choose the report :guilabel:`Purchase Order - Request for Quotation` in the :guilabel:`Modify Existing Report`
dialog box, and then click :guilabel:`Open Report`.

.. figure::  images/openoffice_quotation.png
   :scale: 65
   :align: center

   *Modifying a document template*

OpenOffice.org then opens the report in edit mode for you. You can modify it using the standard word
processing functions of OpenOffice.org Writer.

The document is modified in its English version. It will be translated as usual by OpenERP's
translation system when you use it through the client interface, if you have configured your own setup
to translate to another language for you. So you only need to modify the template once, even if your
system uses other languages – but you will need to add translations as described earlier in this
chapter if you add fields or change the content of the existing ones.

.. tip:: Older Reports

	The older reports may not all have been converted into the new form supported by OpenERP.
	Data expressions in the old format are shown within double brackets and not in OpenOffice.org
	fields.

	You can transform an old report format to the new format from the OpenOffice.org menu
	:menuselection:`OpenERP Report Designer --> Convert Brackets -> Fields`.

From the OpenERP toolbar in OpenOffice.org it is possible to:

* connect to the OpenERP server: by supplying the connection parameters.

* add a loop: select a related field amongst the available fields from the proposed object, for
  example \ ``Order Lines``\  . When it is printed, this loop will execute for each line of the order.
  The loop can be put into a table (the lines will then repeat) or into an OpenOffice.org
  section.

* add a field: you can then go through the whole OpenERP database from the selected object and
  then a particular field.

* add an expression: enter an expression in the Python language to calculate values from any fields
  in the selected object.

.. tip:: Python Expressions

	Using the :guilabel:`Add an expression` button, you can enter expressions in the Python language.
	These expressions can use all of the object's fields for their calculations.

	For example if you make a report on an order you can use the following expression:

	'%.2f' % (amount_total * 0.9,)

	In this example, ``amount_total`` is a field from the ``purchase.order`` object.
	The result will be 90% of the total of the order, formatted to two decimal places.

.. todo:: - Is this a specification for a bit more writing?
.. :menuselection:`OpenERP Report --> Send to server`
.. *Technical Name*  *Report Name* \ ``Sale Order Mod``\
.. *Corporate Header*  *Send Report to Server*

You can check the result in OpenERP using the menu :menuselection:`Purchases --> Purchase Management --> Requests
for Quotation`.

.. index::
   single: report; new
..

Creating a New Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo:: Another specification?
.. :menuselection:`OpenERP Report --> Open a new report` \ ``Sale Order``\
.. :guilabel:`Open New Report` :guilabel:`Use Model in Report`

The general template is made up of loops (such as the list of selected orders) and fields from the
object, which can also be looped. Format them to your requirements, then save the template.

The existing report templates make up a rich source of examples. You can start by adding the loops
and several fields to create a minimal template.

When the report has been created, send it to the server by clicking :menuselection:`OpenERP Report Designer
--> Send to the server`, which brings up the :guilabel:`Send To Server` dialog box. A
:guilabel:`Technical Name` for the report is assigned by default, to make it appear beside the other purchase order
reports. Rename the template as \ ``New Request for Quotation`` \ in :guilabel:`Report Name`, check the
checkbox :guilabel:`Corporate Header` and finally click :guilabel:`Send Report to Server`.

To send it to the server, you can specify if you prefer OpenERP to produce a PDF when the user
prints the document, or if OpenERP should open the document for editing in OpenOffice.org Writer
before printing. To do that choose \ ``PDF`` \, \ ``OpenOffice`` \ (SXW)
or \ ``HTML`` \ in the field :guilabel:`Select Rpt. Type`.

.. index::
   single; report; common headers

Creating Common Headers for Reports
-----------------------------------

When saving new reports and reports that you have modified, you are given the option to select a
header. This header is a template that creates a standard page header and footer containing data
that is defined in each database.

This template can be customized by changing the company information through the menu
:menuselection:`Administration --> Companies --> Companies`. You may select your parent company from the list
and edit the fields Report Header, Report Footer 1, Report Footer 2 in the :guilabel:`General Information` tab.
If your company has a logo that you would want to appear in all reports, you may add it using the :guilabel:`Logo` field.
You can also change the appearance of the header/footer by editing the XML code in the tabs :guilabel:`Header/Footer`
and :guilabel:`Internal Header/Footer`.
