Process: Sales and Purchases
============================

At this point, we have defined everything that we need, we can now execute the process.

The following example will be structured as follows: 

First, we will make a sales order for one unit of our product (Basic PC) in the company 
OpenERP France for the customer NotSoTiny. Then this will be sent to the company OpenERP 
Belgium that stocks the Basic PCs. An order of one unit will be sent to OpenERP Belgium 
from OpenERP France. OpenERP will purchase the product from its supplier (in this case, 
Dell Belgium). Second, OpenERP France will have to invoice the delivered quantities sent 
by OpenERP Belgium to NotSoTiny.
