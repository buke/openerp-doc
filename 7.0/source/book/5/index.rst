Manage your Warehouse and Get your Manufacturing Done
#####################################################

 This part of the book concentrates on physical materials - the handling of stock and
 the transformation of materials by assembly and manufacture.

 Stocks are the physical embodiment of their product specification, things rather than
 datasheets. So they need to be stored and moved between locations, and tracked in
 sets and individually. They have a size, a weight, and a cost.
 OpenERP manages all of this in some rather useful and unique ways.

 Manufacturing is the transformation of materials and components, perhaps using measurable
 resources, into other products and services, adding value to your company on the way.
