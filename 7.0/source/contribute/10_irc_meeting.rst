Introduction

Once a month, we will organize a community IRC meeting. All topics related to
the community, the OpenERP product, the Open Object project can be discussed
during this meeting. The meeting is open to partners, the management at Tiny
and every member of the community.

It allows all actors on OpenERP to discuss about all aspects of the software
or the organisation of the project.

The community meeting should be planned in the calendar of the OpenERP
website, the first Tuesday of each month, at 1pm, UTC. You can check the exact
date conversion for your country here:

A few days before the meeting, a proposition of points to discuss is published
in the OpenERP wiki. People are free to add (don't remove) or categorize topics.
You can pre-discuss about some topics in the forum or our official IRC channel.

A post on the planet will be made a few days before the meeting. This post must include,
at least:

The phases of the meeting
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the beginning of each meeting, we will select:
* A responsible to organize and respect the list of topics
* Someone to write a summary during the meeting
These two people are publicly announced.

Then, the responsible of the meeting provide 2 links to be read:
* This page: that explains the meeting organization,
* The page containing the proposition of topics.

Then, we ask if someone wants to add some topics in the proposed list. If yes,
the different elements are added in the list of topics, in the right section.


Presentations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People can write their names and the company they work for.

Discussion on topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The responsible of the meeting announces the topics one by one. Each new topics
should be emphasized so that it's clear when we read the logs:

* ---- New TOPIC ----

It's important to discuss ONLY about the current topic to keep a clean
structure in the meeting organisation. The responsible is the one that
should organise the discussion, by asking people to wait the right
topic to discuss on some points.

Topics can be no longer than 15 minutes. If a topic is too long, the
responsible of the meeting can request to continue on the next topic and,
if needed, ask a new date to discuss this topic specifically.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

The responsible to write the summary copy/paste his summary in the IRC
channel. The summary must contain in minimum:
* List of assigned tasks (who do what)
* List of points to discuss in next meeting

People can criticise this summary, if the responsible missed some points.

The summary should not contain the thoughts or the full discussion of the
people, the IRC log is accessible for this.


Summary Post
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The responsible of the summary writes a post in the planet with the summary
of the IRC meeting.
