First steps with Open ERP
#########################

 Open ERP is an impressive software system, being simple to use and yet providing great benefits
 in helping you manage your company.
 It's easy to install under both Windows and Linux compared with other enterprise-scale systems,
 and offers unmatched functionality.

 The objective of this first part of the book is to help you to start discovering it in practice.

 The first chapter, :ref:`ch-inst`, gives detailed guidance for installing it.
 Next, in :ref:`ch-guided`, you're taken on a step-by-step guided tour using the information in its demonstration
 database.
 Then in :ref:`ch-real` you can try out a real case, from scratch in a new database,
 by developing a complete business workflow that runs from purchase to sale of goods.
