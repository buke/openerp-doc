Information Systems have played an increasingly visible role over the past several years in
improving the competitiveness of business.
More than just tools for handling repetitive tasks, they're used to guide and advance
all of a company's daily activities. Integrated management software is today very often a
key source of significant competitive advantage. 

Such software is commonly called an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. This book
is about the use of OpenERP, a leading ERP system, 
for manufacturing and stock management. It's one of a series of books from Open Object Press on the use
of OpenERP in a range of enterprise settings.

Risks and integration costs are important barriers to all the advantages you gain from such systems.
That's why, today, few small- and medium-sized companies use ERP.
In addition, the larger ERP vendors such as SAP, Microsoft and Oracle haven't been able
to reconcile the power and comprehensive cover of an ERP system with the simplicity and flexibility
wanted by the users.
But this is exactly what small and medium enterprises are looking for.

The development processes of open source software, and the new business models adopted by their
developers,
provide a new way of resolving such problems of cost and quality for this kind of enterprise
software.

To make an ERP system fully available to small and medium enterprises, cost reduction is the first
priority.
Open source software makes it possible to greatly reduce development costs by
aggressive reuse of open source software libraries; to eliminate intermediaries (the distributors),
with all of their expensive sales overhead; to cut out selling costs by free publication of the
software;
and to considerably reduce the marketing overhead.

Since there is open interaction among thousands of contributors and partners working on the same
project,
the quality of the resulting software benefits greatly from the scrutiny.
And you can't be everything at once: accountant, software developer, salesperson,
ISO 9001 quality professional, specialist in agricultural products,
expert in the customs and habits of pharmaceutical vendors, just as a start.

Faced with these wide-ranging requirements, what could be better than a world network of
partners and contributors?
Everyone adds their own contribution according to their professional competence.
Throughout this book you'll see that the results exceed any reasonable expectations when such work
is well organized.

But the real challenge of development is to make this solution simple and flexible, as well as
complete.
And to reach this level of quality you need a leader and co-ordinator who can organize all of these
activities.
So the development team of Tiny ERP, today called Open ERP, is responsible for most of
the organization, synchronization and coherence of the software.

And Open ERP offers great performance in all these areas!

Because of its modularity, collaborative developments in Open ERP have been cleanly integrated,
enabling any company to choose from a large list of available functions.
As with most open source software, accessibility, flexibility, and simplicity are important keywords
for development.
Experience has shown that there's no need to train users for several months on the system,
because they can just download it and use it directly.

So you'll find the modules for all types of needs, allowing your company to build its customized
system
by simply grouping and configuring the most suitable modules. Hundreds of modules are available.

They range from specific modules like the EDI interface for agricultural products,
which has been used to interface with Match and Leclerc stores, up to the generic demonstration
automation
module for ordering sandwiches, which can take care of the eating preference of your staff.

The results are impressive. Open ERP (originally called Tiny ERP) is management
software that is downloaded more than any other in the world, with over 600 downloads per day.
It's available today in 18 languages and has a world network of partners and contributors.
Over 800 developers participate in the projects on the collaborative development system.

To our knowledge, OpenERP is the only management system which is routinely used not only by big
companies but also by very small companies and independent companies. This diversity is an
illustration of the software's flexibility: a rather elegant coordination between people's
functional expectations of the software and great simplicity in its use.

And diversity is also found in the various sectors and trades which use the software, including
agricultural products, textiles, public auctions, IT, and trade associations.

Lastly, such software has arisen from the blend of high code quality, well-judged architecture and
use of free technologies. In fact, you may be surprised (if you're an IT person) to find that the
size of OpenERP is less than 4 MB when you've installed the software. We've moved a long way from
the days when the only people who could be expected to benefit from ERP were the owners of a widget
factory on some remote industrial estate.

    \subsection*{Why this book ?}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Why this book ?}

.. *

Many books set out to tell readers about the management of enterprise, and equally many aim to
instruct the reader in the use of a piece of specialized software. We're not aiming to add to those
lists because our approach is intended to be different.

Having restructured and reorganized many businesses, we wanted our management experience to generate
a work that is both instructive and practical. It was important for us not to write a manual about
OpenERP, but instead a work that deals with advanced management techniques realized through these
IT tools. You'll see what management practices might be useful, what's possible, and then how you
could achieve that in OpenERP.

It's this that we'll consider OpenERP for: not as an end in itself but just the tool you use to put
an advanced management system into place.

.. *

Written by two CEOs who have been successful with new technologies, this book is aimed at directors
and managers who have an ambition to improve the performance of their whole company's management
team. They're likely already to have significant responsibilities and possess the influence to get
things done in their company.

It's likely that most readers will come from small- and medium-sized enterprises (up to a few
hundred staff), and independent companies, because of the breadth of functions that need to be
analyzed and involved in change. The same principles also apply to larger companies, however.

    \section*{Structure of this book}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Structure of this book}

.. *

Part I, :ref:`part1-steps`, starts with the installation of OpenERP. If you have already installed OpenERP you
can directly take your first steps on a guided tour in the :ref:`ch-guided` chapter. If you're already familiar
with OpenERP or Tiny ERP you can use the :ref:`ch-real` chapter to find out how to create a new workflow from
scratch in an empty database with nothing to distract you. Or you can skip directly to the :ref:`ch-sales` chapter in
the :ref:`part-trade` part, to start with details of OpenERP's functional modules.

Part II, :ref:`part-trade`, deals with Selling and Purchasing goods and services.

Part III, :ref:`part-phys`, describes the physical movement of Stocks and their Manufacture 
(the transformation or products and services into other products).

Part IV, :ref:`part-qual`, is focused on the Process description that OpenERP
manages.

Finally Part V, :ref:`part-config`, structured in two chapters, explains first how to administer and configure Open
ERP then provides a methodology for implementing OpenERP in the enterprise.
