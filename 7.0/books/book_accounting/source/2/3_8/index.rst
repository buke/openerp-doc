Financial Analysis
******************

 *This chapter is dedicated to statutory taxation and financial reporting from OpenERP.
 Whether you need reports about customers and suppliers, or statements for various statutory purposes,
 OpenERP enables you to carry out a whole range of parametric analyses regarding the financial health of
 your company.*

Whether you want to analyse the general health of your company or review the status of an Account Receivable in detail, your company's accounts are the place to define your various business indicators.

To show you the most accurate picture of your business, OpenERP's accounting reports are flexible, and the results are calculated in real time. This enables you to automate recurring actions and to change your operations quickly when a company-wide problem (such as cash reserves
dropping too low or receivables climbing too high) or a local problem (a customer that has not paid, or a project budget overspend) occurs.

This chapter describes the various reports and financial statements supplied by OpenERP's
accounting modules. It also describes how OpenERP handles purchase and sales taxation, and the
related tax reporting.
